## 🧩 Architecture
The EbuBridge LMS System follows the Onion Architecture, which emphasizes the separation of concerns and dependency inversion. Below is a simplified representation of the architecture:

```
[ Presentation Layer ]
        |
[ Application Layer ]
        |
[ Domain Layer ]
        |
[ Infrastructure Layer ]
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- Store sensitive information, such as API keys and connection strings, securely.
- Implement proper validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
